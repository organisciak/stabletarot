# AI Tarot Generator

This code uses GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion to generator custom tarot card themes, with readings and card images. I wrote it to interact with a thermal printer (i.e. a receipt printer), so it outputs black and white styles, though that can be changed. See the notebook - the code wasn't prepared with others in mind, but shouldn't be difficult to adapt to your use case.
